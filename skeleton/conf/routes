#HOST   METHOD  PATH                                    ACTION
*       GET     /                                       App.Index

# Ignore favicon requests
*       GET     /favicon.ico                            404

# The HOST route is optional. Without it, the route line would look like:
#METHOD PATH                                    ACTION

# Map static resources from the /app/public folder to the /public path
GET     /public/*filepath                       Static.Serve("public")

# Catch all
*       /:controller/:action                    :controller.:action
