# The HttpOnly attribute is supported by most modern browsers. On a supported
# browser, an HttpOnly session cookie will be used only when transmitting HTTP
# (or HTTPS) requests, thus restricting access from other, non-HTTP APIs (such
# as JavaScript). This restriction mitigates, but does not eliminate the threat
# of session cookie theft via cross-site scripting (XSS). This feature applies
# only to session-management cookies, and not other browser cookies.
